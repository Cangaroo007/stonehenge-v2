## Resolved

| ID | Description | Resolution | PR |
|----|-------------|------------|----|
| A-03 | slab-optimizer.ts not L/U shape aware — oversize splitter fires on bounding box before decomposition | Shape decomposition moved to Step 1 (before oversize splitting). Each leg is now checked individually against slab dimensions. | fix/optimizer-shape-before-oversize |
| R-12 | AUDIT_TRACKER.md not enforced — documentation steps skipped by Claude Code | pre-push hook now blocks pushes on fix/* feat/* branches if tracker not updated | fix/enforce-audit-tracker-hook |
